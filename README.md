# 30 Days of Kotlin
30 Days of Kotlin with Google Developers is an initiative to improve
your understanding of Kotlin and apply it in real projects using Google
resources (codelabs, sessions with Googlers) between 7th May - 7th of June.

## Cholti | চলতি
The idea of the application is to provide Bengali (বাংলা) pronunciation of
some essentials. The chosen categories are `Words`, `Phrases`, `Colors` and `Numbers`.
Each category has 5 distinct elements that have their english and bengali script
along with the proper bengali pronunciation. The `illustrations` in app are original
artworks by two of my friends [Ritwik](https://twitter.com/RahaRitwik) and [Rajwrita](https://twitter.com/rajwrita).
The voice that you get to hear is from my friend [Puja](https://twitter.com/pleb_talks).

### Concepts implemented in the project
1. Guidelines with constraint-layout.
2. Intents.
3. Recycler-view.
4. Material Library.
